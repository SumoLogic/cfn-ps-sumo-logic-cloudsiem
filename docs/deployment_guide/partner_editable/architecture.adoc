As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* In all current and new AWS accounts in your AWS organization:
** Amazon GuardDuty to help protect AWS accounts and workloads from malicious activity and report security events to Amazon CloudWatch.
** AWS Security Hub to assess security alerts and security posture across AWS accounts. Security Hub relays security events to CloudWatch.
** AWS WAF for a web application firewall to help protect the resources in your organization from common web exploits.
** AWS Network Firewall to deploy essential network protections for all your Amazon virtual private clouds (VPCs).
** AWS Firewall Manager to deploy AWS WAF and AWS Network Firewall rules across the VPCs in your organization, to control traffic leaving and entering your network.

* In your security tooling account:
** Amazon CloudWatch to relay security events to AWS Lambda integration functions.
** Lambda integration functions to do two things. First, to create a Sumo collector and multiple sources. A collector is an agent that receives logs from a source before encrypting and forwarding them to a Sumo service. A source is a configuration that collects logs from your AWS services. Second, to install the security apps you select during deployment to your Sumo logic account.
** Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to forward AWS WAF logs to Sumo Logic.
** An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store AWS Network Firewall logs.
** An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to publish logs to Sumo Logic when Network Firewall saves logs to the S3 bucket.

* In your organization management account, AWS CloudTrail to track user activity and API usage in the organization.

* In your log archive account:
** An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store CloudTrail logs.
** An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to publish logs to Sumo Logic when CloudTrail saves logs to the S3 bucket.

NOTE: This Quick Start deploys Amazon GuardDuty and AWS CloudTrail across all accounts in your organization, incurring costs for these services in each account.
