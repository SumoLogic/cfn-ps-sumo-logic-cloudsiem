//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a partner account. If there are no predeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps

Before deploying this Quick Start, complete the following steps:

* If you don't already have a Sumo Logic enterprise account, create one at https://sumologic.com[^] by following the on-screen instructions.

* If you don't already have an AWS organization, create one. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tutorials_basic.html[Tutorial: Creating and configuring an organization^].

* Ensure that your IAM user has sufficient permissions for the IAM user or role in your https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/org-management.html[organization management account] to create an organization trail and enable GuardDuty.

* Enable trusted access with AWS Organizations. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-enable-trusted-access.html[Enable trusted access with AWS Organizations^]. Otherwise, since this is a multi-account deployment, AWS CloudFormation won't run.

* If you don't already have them, create separate https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/security-tooling.html[security tooling^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/log-archive.html[log archive accounts^] in your AWS organization.

* Ensure that GuardDuty has not been enabled by the security tooling account (delegated administrator). For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.html[Managing GuardDuty accounts with AWS Organizations^].

* Become familiar with the <<_additional_resources,additional resources>>, later in this guide.

=== Existing AWS security service configurations

If you’re already sending Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) data to Sumo Logic, the Threat Intel for AWS app can report that data. 

:xrefstyle: short

If you’ve already configured one or more AWS services listed in <<existing_configurations_table>>, follow the steps provided for that service in the table. If you have not configured these services, this Quick Start automatically configures them when you install the Sumo Logic apps.
