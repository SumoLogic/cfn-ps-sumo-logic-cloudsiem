// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

=== If using an existing S3 bucket

If you use an existing S3 bucket with logs, create an SNS topic (SumoSNSTopic-{StackName}) that subscribes to the Sumo Logic sources. After the deployment completes, add that SNS topic to the S3 bucket events. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/enable-event-notifications.html[Enabling and configuring event notifications using the Amazon S3 console^].

=== View the Sumo Logic dashboards

After the deployment completes, the Sumo Logic apps are added to your Sumo Logic personal-account library in a folder named `SumoLogic Amazon QuickStart Apps for AWS Orgs <date>`, as shown in <<qsappfolder>>.

Under the SumoLogic Amazon QuickStart Apps <date> folder, there are subfolders that represent each app along with the date and timestamp.

To open the services dashboard, choose its folder in the Sumo Logic console. For instance, under the Amazon GuardDuty folder, open the Amazon GuardDuty – Overview dashboard to see detected threats.

=== Firewall Manager security group

The deployment creates a security group that is used by Firewall Manager only as a comparison reference for the security groups that are in scope of the policy. Firewall Manager doesn't associate it with any resources in your organization. You can update the security group for your use case. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/security-group-policies.html[Security group policies].

Firewall Manager creates a web ACL in each account that's managed by Firewall Manager.

=== AWS Firewall Manager AWS Network Firewall policies

* The Resource type for a Network Firewall policy is always VPC

* Resources allows you to narrow the scope of your policy by specifying resource tags for inclusion. To use tagging, you need to first tag your resources. In Your VPCs, you use Resource tags with **key**: **__sumo-awsqs-nf-policy__** and **value**: **__network-firewall__**. For more information about tagging your resources, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html[Working with Tag Editor]

=== AWS Firewall Manager​ AWS WAF policies

For Policy tags, you can add any identifying tags that you want for the Firewall Manager AWS WAF policy. For more information about tags, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html[Working with Tag Editor].

* In your Application Load Balancer and API Gateway Stage for rule groups: AWS Core rule set, AWS SQL database, AWS Amazon IP reputation list, you use Resource tags with **key**: **__sumo-awsqs-default-policy__** and **value**: **__true__**

* In your Application Load Balancer and API Gateway Stage for rule groups: AWS Linux operating system, you use Resource tags with **key**: **__sumo-awsqs-linux-policy__** and **value**: **__linux__**

* In your Application Load Balancer and API Gateway Stage for rule groups: AWS Windows operating system, you use Resource tags with **key**: **__sumo-awsqs-windows-policy__** and **value**: **__windows__**

* In your Application Load Balancer and API Gateway Stage for rule groups: AWS POSIX operating system, you use Resource tags with **key**: **__sumo-awsqs-posix-policy__** and **value**: **__posix__**
